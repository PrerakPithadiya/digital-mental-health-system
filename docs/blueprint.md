## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Clarity Blue (#64B5F6) for a calming and stable feel. Used for primary actions and navigation.
- Background color: Whisper Blue (#F0F8FF) Creates a light, airy, and open atmosphere.
- Accent color: Growth Green (#81C784) for positive reinforcement, success states, and calls-to-action that encourage progress.
- Neutral Text: Graphite (#333D47) - A soft, dark gray instead of pure black. Easier on the eyes and feels more sophisticated for all body text and headlines.
- Borders & Dividers: Stone (#DDE2E5) - A subtle, low-contrast gray for creating gentle separation without harsh lines.
- Action/Urgent: Warm Coral (#F28B82) - For the Urgent Support button. This color is noticeable and signals importance without inducing the alarm of a bright red. It's warm, human, and actionable.
- Headlines & Titles: Lora (Serif) - This font has gentle curves and a calligraphic feel, lending an air of wisdom, credibility, and warmth to all major headings. It feels like a trusted guide.
- Body & UI Elements: PT Sans (Sans-serif) - Retained for its exceptional clarity and readability in smaller sizes, ensuring the interface is effortless to navigate.
- All icons will be custom-designed in a soft, hand-drawn style. They will feature organic lines and rounded edges, avoiding sharp, geometric precision. They will be two-toned: a Graphite outline with a subtle Whisper Blue or Growth Green internal fill to add depth.
- The app will feature a suite of bespoke illustrations. Style: Abstract and flowing, using shapes and nature-inspired motifs (leaves, water ripples, soft light) rather than literal representations. Characters will be faceless and inclusive. Usage: Onboarding screens, empty states and as background textures in the Resource Library to create an immersive, artful experience.
- A consistent 12-column grid will provide a robust and harmonious structure.
- All padding and margins will use an 8px scale (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.). This mathematical precision creates a subconscious sense of order and calm.
- Cards used for articles or counselor profiles will have soft drop shadows and rounded corners to make them feel tangible and gentle.
- All animations will be gentle and fluid, using ease-in-out timing functions to avoid abrupt, jarring movements.
- Button Hovers: A subtle lift or a soft color fade, providing clear feedback.
- Page Transitions: A gentle cross-fade effect when navigating between main sections.
- Loading States: A calming, pulsating breathing animation instead of a spinning wheel.
- Positive Reinforcement: When a user completes a task (like booking an appointment), the confirmation checkmark will gracefully animate into view.
